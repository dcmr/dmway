# mdgateway

The objective of this project is to develop an application that links a network of sensors and Thingsboard.
This application includes:
- checking the format of the data received by the sensors
- data persistence
- the creation of sensors on Thingsboard
- the provision of data on Thingsboard

This approach is a direct alternative to Thingsboard Gateway, offering a more generic vision.
